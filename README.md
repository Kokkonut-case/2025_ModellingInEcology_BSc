# 2025_ModellingInEcology_BSc
The three files included here were written by small teams of students that participated in the winter semester 2025-2026 "Theoretical Evolutionary Ecology" Bachelors elective module. Each team was tasked with writing a simple model to test a research question they developed in the first half of the subject. Students were guided by the postdoc coordinators, but the work is their own.

The file "demography" presents two models - one stochastic, one deterministic - of age-structured population growth 
The file "sex ratio" presents three models (local-mate competition, feminization, male-killing) that might explain the evolution of sex ratio different from 1:1  
The file "clutch size" presents a life-history model about the evolution of clutch size depending on juvenile mortality
